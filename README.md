# Hi, I'm Roberto Aragy! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a **Data Scientist** and **Machine Learning Engineer** with over **10 years of experience** in software development and more than **6 years** in machine learning, currently working at the **Court of Justice**, where I am developing **Generative AI (GenAI)** and **RAG systems** for document summarization, QA, and legal text simplification.

## ðŸ”§ My Key Expertise:
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Data Science & Machine Learning**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Hugginface, Spacy
- **NLP & LLMs**: 6+ years of experience working with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs), including fine-tuning models like Mistral and Llama for legal and business applications
- **Cloud Platforms & DevOps**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Vertex AI, BigQuery, Docker, Kubernetes
- **MLOps & Deployment**: Expertise in building and managing ML pipelines using MLOps principles, including model serving and orchestration with Kubernetes and Vertex AI
- **Legal AI Systems**: Building AI-driven tools to simplify judicial text, generate case summaries, and automate decision-making insights

## ðŸ’¼ Professional Experience:
I have extensive experience contributing to **cutting-edge AI projects** in the legal tech space, helping organizations build smarter, more efficient processes. I've led projects that involve everything from **data preparation** and **annotation** to **model deployment** and **API integration**, following best practices in **MLOps**.

Recent projects include:
- **GenAI and RAG systems**: Developing advanced generative models and retrieval-augmented generation systems to summarize legal documents, generate reports, and simplify complex legal language.
- **Automated Legal Summarization Systems**: Implementing tools to extract meaningful insights from court case documents using NLP techniques and Langchain.

## ðŸ“š Ongoing Projects:
- Fine-tuning LLMs: Continuously experimenting with **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** on models like Mistral and Llama to adapt them to specific legal and business contexts.

## ðŸŒ± Personal Growth:
I'm always learning new tools and technologies to stay on top of the rapidly evolving data engineering landscape. Currently, I'm exploring LangGraph, CrewAI, and Ollama.
